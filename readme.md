Here is the place to tell the story of your experience of the Data Analytics Program.


## Let me introduce Myself
I started off professionally as a Development planner after earning a degree in the discipline. But in my formative years, I always had Tech at heart. This passion drove me to study for a hardware and networking program while I worked as a Customer Service Specialist. I was able to switch roles to become an IT Support Officer. With a further urge to explore a tech career, I went on to take the Azubi Data Analytics Professional program, and I can humbly call myself a Data Analyst thanks to Azubi Africa.

## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program?
The Azubi Data Analytics program changed my thoughts about the data analytics program. The well-tailored course structure and method of delivery were excellent.

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics?Â 
The Career Accelerator phase not only increased my knowledge in the data analytics program but also helped me sharpen my skills in writing a winning CV, which increased my possibilities of being gainfully employed.

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
simply a golden opportunity to change careers. The financing options provided also made the program more enticing.


## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program?Â 
With the knowledge I have amassed from this program, it is safe to say I am able to well understand, analyse and visualize data better.

## What are my plans for the future?


## What is my dream company or role ?
I yearn to grow to become a Senior Data Scientist in a silicon valley company soon. :blush: :+1:
